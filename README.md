# College War - Narrative Card Game for Student Life
"College War" is a narrative card game that puts the user in the shoes of a university student. During the course of a game, a series of dilemmas arise, and the player's decisions have consequences, some of which are sometimes unexpected. They determine his or her academic success or ... their unemployment.

This project is part of the PJS4 portion of the DUT Informatique Curriculum. The project is carried out in groups of 5 or 6 students for 4 months, with an accompanying tutor. The project must be multidisciplinary and the subject is freely chosen by the students.

For our application, we were heavily inspired by one of the popular mobile game "Reigns" and its associated products: "Reigns: Game of Thrones" & "Reigns: Her Majesty".

The goal of the game is quite straightforward : graduate college. The most intriguing aspect: each choice has only two solutions. The game is based on these five founding elements: "Knowledge", "Popularity", "Health", "Money" and "Morality". In order to continue to play and graduate, the player must be careful not to let the gauge for any one of these elements fill up completely, or fall to zero. If the player can survive long enough to complete the intended story, he will graduate !
